            <p>One of the countries I have visited is Spain, I went with a few girl friends and stayed for a week.
                We visited many historical sites such as Park Guell and the La Sagrada Familia. Which when we went three
                years ago
                they were doing construction on, and it is believed to be finished in 2026, and the construction started
                in
                1882.
