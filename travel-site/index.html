            <p>I have always had a deep desire to travel, but with lack of money and time and now recently,
                COVID becoming a problem, my dreams to travel have been limited to mostly within the states.
                I have only been to 3 other countries:
                Canada, Mexice and Spain, hopefully I get to expand that list soon.
                Some countries that I would absolutely love to visit are Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Australia,
                amongst many others.
