            <p>One thing that has always drawn me to the Netherlands is there tulip fields.
                They look beyond beautiful and I would love to see it with my own eyes.

            <p> The architucture in the Netherlands is something that captures me, I love how tight nit all the
                buildings are
                as well as how old they are, they each tell a story. I live in a suburban area where almost all houses
                are cookie cutters
                and look exactly the same.
