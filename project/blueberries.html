                                <p>Blueberries are well known for being an antioxidant, it is one of the highest levels
                                    of all fruits
                                    and vegetables. Blueberries protect cholesterol in your blood from becoming damaged,

                                <p>I personally got to go blueberry picking this summer, twice. I went to a little farm
                                    in Michigan, the first
                                    time I went was in July and they blueberries were so large, and so sweet and tasty.
                                    Then I went again in August
                                    and the difference in size and taste was drastic!
                                    The blueberries we so much tinier and tarter, was a little disappointed because I
                                    thought they were going to be that
                                    large size again but apparently blueberries are larger in the earlier season.
